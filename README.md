## Usage of the code:

1. For evaluation the performance of our model : 
 Our model is saved in "prediction_model.pickle"
 Just load your test data in "Synthesis_Evaluation.ipynb" as X_test and y_test, and run that notebook.
 
2. For reproduction of our work:  
 Put the notebooks and the original data in the same directory, and run the notebook in the following order:
 1. Preprocessing.ipynb
 2. Prediction_Model.ipynb
 3. xxx.ipynb
 4. Synthesis_Evaluation.ipynb
